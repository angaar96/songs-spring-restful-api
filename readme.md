# Songs Spring API 

This API, built using Spring & Maven in Java, allows songs to be created, retrieved, deleted, and edited from different endpoints.

You may access all songs using a GET request from the endpoint: "https://localhost:8080/songs" <br>
You may delete, add or edit a song using either a DELETE, POST or PUT request respectively, using the endpoint: "https://localhost:8080/songs/{id}"
where id corresponds to a song id.
